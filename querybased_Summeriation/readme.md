# Query based summarization: -
Query based summarization is defined as the extracting the particular information from within words that means essential information that answers the query from original text. With the increasing the demands of solution of the problems in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing is one of the most challenging tasks. Query based text summarizer is the most defined and explored topic in the field of natural language processing which involves processing of text document with an appropriate result based on an input query. Query based text summarizer is based on the two techniques that is sentence- sentence and sentence- word – relationship using graph structure. 

# Getting started: -
